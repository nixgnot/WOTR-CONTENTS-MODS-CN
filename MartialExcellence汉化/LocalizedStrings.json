Skinwalker shamans say they are chosen by nature or the gods to be a bridge between the world of humanity and the animal world. The truth may lie somewhere between these two ideas. For indeed, skinwalkers are those with a lycanthrope crouching somewhere in the branches of their family tree. These distant progeny of monstrous werewolves and other creatures of the night have special talents unlike those of most civilized peoples, and they arise randomly among remote humanoid populations as well as within their own secretive sects. A pair of humans may give birth to a skinwalker—the dormant lycanthropic ancestry making itself known in a child neither beast nor human—or a pair of skinwalker parents may produce a skinwalker child, though these couplings can sometimes produce human children as well.",

Many werewolves and witchwolves live in seminomadic bands as traders, mystics, adventurers, or entertainers, allowing them to wreak havoc in remote settlements before slipping off into the darkness to escape the subsequent suspicion and hostility of townsfolk. Most such bands include only werewolves or only werewolf-kin, but occasionally one group adopts a member of the other sort out of circumstance or convenience, particularly if the two share common blood.\nWerewolf-kin generally have prominent eyebrows that grow together, long index fingers, or wild hair that seems impossible to tame. Witchwolf packs are often led by witches trained in a tradition of curses and transformation tied closely to the original curse of lycanthropy; these witches are also usually the most powerful members of their packs, though exceptions exist where a witch leads with the aid of a favored ally of incredible strength. Because werewolf-kin cannot recruit ordinary humans the way werewolves can, they tend to be more cautious and maintain closer bonds with their fellows than true werewolves usually do, and their bands typically consist of only one or a few extended families or possibly longtime friends. \nWitchwolf skinwalkers have a +2 racial bonus to Constitution, a +2 racial bonus to Wisdom, a -2 penalty to Intelligence, a +2 bonus to Perception checks, and a +2 bonus to Lore(Nature) checks. They can use Magic Fang once per day using their Wisdom as their spell casting ability.",

They take slaves from other races, orc men brutalize orc women, and both abuse children and elders, on the grounds that anyone too feeble to fight back deserves little more than a life of suffering.
